These are the rules for running stdcbench and reporting the results.

COMPILING AND EXECUTING:

* The same compiler version and options shall be used for all parts of stdcbench, unless explicitly stated otherwise in the reported results

REPORTING RESULTS:

For any results reported the following information shall be included:

* The version of stdcbench used.
* The stdcbench modules (c90base, c90lib, etc) enabled.
* If some modules were disabled, a rationale for this (e.g. hardware or compiler limitations).
* The compiler used to compile stdcbench (including the version and options used).
* The platform on which stdcbench was run (hardware, if applicable clock speed, if applicable OS).
* If stdcbech reported errors, this fact.
* If there were no errors, the total score (reporting of scores for individual modules is optional).
* Sufficient information to reproduce the results.

APPLICABILITY OF RULES:

stdcbench is licensed under GPL2 (or any later version). This license allows you to ignore the rules above when running stdcbench or modifications of it. Note however:
* You may not misrepresent results obtained with a modified version as results from the original version.
* You may not misrepresent results obtained ignoring the above rules as results obtained following the rules.
* The GPL (at least both versions 2 and 3) requires modified version to be clearly marked as such when they are distributed.
